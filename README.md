# About Me

Hi, I'm Merve! I graduated from the Management Information Systems department at Dokuz Eylul University Turkey in 2021. After that, I took a break from my career to move to the United States and improve my English. I have settled here and now feel ready to start my career in data analysis.

As a motivated and detail-oriented entry-level Data Analyst, I am eager to apply my strong analytical skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions. I have a solid foundation in data analysis techniques, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis, and am proficient in tools like Excel, SQL, and Python. Through academic projects and internships, I have gained hands-on experience working with datasets to uncover insights and present them in clear, actionable formats.

I am passionate about learning and continuously improving my technical skills, and I am particularly excited about using data to solve real-world problems. My ability to work with large datasets, attention to detail, and problem-solving mindset make me confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. I am also a strong communicator, able to present complex data findings in a simple and understandable way.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
